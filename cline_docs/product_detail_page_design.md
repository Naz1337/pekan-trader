# Product Detail Page Design (`show.blade.php`)

## 1. Purpose

This document outlines the design and implementation details for the overhauled product display page at `resources/views/products/show.blade.php`. The goal was to enhance the product detail page by integrating more information and improving its visual presentation, drawing inspiration from the product card component design while maintaining a clear and user-friendly layout for a single product.

## 2. File Location

The Blade view is located at:
`resources/views/products/show.blade.php`

## 3. Key Features & Enhancements

The product detail page incorporates several features to enhance user experience:

### 3.1. Overall Layout and Structure

*   The existing two-column layout (image/add-to-cart on left, product details on right) was retained and enhanced for styling and spacing.

### 3.2. Enhanced Product Image Section (Left Column)

*   **Image Gallery:** The existing AlpineJS-powered image gallery was retained.
*   **Styling:** Maintained appropriate `w-full`, `max-w-lg`, `min-h-100`, `object-contain`, `rounded-box`, and `mx-auto` classes for the main image.

### 3.3. Product Information and Details Section (Right Column)

*   **Product Name & Price:** Retained their prominence.
*   **Product Category:** Introduced prominently with the `<x-icon.tag />` component:
    ```blade
    @if($product->category)
        <div class="text-md text-base-content/70 mb-4 flex items-center">
            <x-icon.tag class="w-4 h-4 mr-2 text-primary"/>
            <span>{{ $product->category->name }}</span>
        </div>
    @endif
    ```
*   **"NEW" Badge:** Displayed if the product is new (created within the last 7 days):
    ```blade
    @if($product->created_at->gt(now()->subDays(7)))
        <span class="badge badge-accent badge-lg font-semibold ml-4">NEW</span>
    @endif
    ```
*   **"Amount Sold" Display:** Integrated the "Amount Sold" logic and display, similar to the product card, using `<x-icon.star />`:
    ```blade
    @php
        $fulfilledQuantity = 0;
        if (method_exists($product, 'orderItems')) {
            $fulfilledQuantity = $product->orderItems()
                ->whereHas('order', function ($query) {
                    $query->where('status', 'completed');
                })
                ->sum('quantity');
        }
    @endphp
    @if($fulfilledQuantity > 0)
        <div class="mb-8 flex items-center gap-2">
            <x-icon.star class="w-5 h-5 text-yellow-500"/>
            <span class="font-semibold text-lg text-base-content/90">{{ $fulfilledQuantity }}</span>
            <span class="text-md text-base-content/70">sold</span>
        </div>
    @endif
    ```
*   **Product Description:** Retained its display with adequate spacing.
*   **Product Specifications:** The existing section was retained as is.

### 3.4. Seller Information and Stock (Left Column, below image gallery)

*   **Seller Information:** Enhanced display with `<x-icon.store />` component and clearer styling:
    ```blade
    <div class="mb-4 flex items-center gap-2">
        <x-icon.store class="w-4 h-4 shrink-0 text-base-content/80"/>
        <strong>Seller:</strong> <span class="link link-hover">{{ $product->seller->business_name }}</span>
    </div>
    ```
*   **Stock Indicator:** Replaced simple text with visual and informative badges:
    ```blade
    <div class="mb-8">
        @if($product->stock_quantity <= 0)
            <span class="badge badge-error badge-lg font-medium">Out of Stock</span>
        @elseif($product->stock_quantity > 0 && $product->stock_quantity <= 10)
            <span class="badge badge-warning badge-lg font-medium">Low Stock ({{ $product->stock_quantity }} left)</span>
        @else
            <span class="badge badge-success badge-lg font-medium">In Stock ({{ $product->stock_quantity }} available)</span>
        @endif
    </div>
    ```

### 3.5. Add to Cart Form

*   The form structure and functionality were retained.

## 4. Styling

The page is styled using Tailwind CSS utility classes and DaisyUI component classes, ensuring a cohesive look with other parts of the website.

## 5. Iconography (Font Awesome via Blade Components)

*   `<x-icon.tag />`: For product category.
*   `<x-icon.store />`: For seller/business name.
*   `<x-icon.star />`: For "Amount Sold" indicator.
